# Yasmin Collyer Portfolio

This is my first Milestone Project for the 'User Centric Frontend Development' module with the Code Institute.

This is my personal portfolio website and will act as an online CV for prospective employers. 
I have icluded all my personal details, work history, coding skills, some links to potential sample work and a contact me section. 
 
## UX
 
My main goal when designing this website was to create a website that is easy to use but still visually appealing and reflective of my personality. I went for a muted pink and dark navy colour scheme as it creates a feminine but still modern feel.



- As an employer, I would easily be able to access all the information needed to make a decision regarding employment. I would be able to see all personal details and have access to previous work and social media. I would also be able to contact easily using the contact form. The website is easy to use and visually appealing.


I have included my plans for the project in my project in a seperate directory. These include some hand written diagrams and a mind-map.



## Features


 
### Existing Features
- Collapsed navbar: Allows the user to access different sections easily and stays collapsed for a minimal look.
- Work-istory timeline: Showcases data in a simple and visual way (based of a previous lesson).
- Skills progress bar: A visual way to showcase skills that is easy to see.


### Features Left to Implement
- Form: I would like to make my contact form functional once I have learned more skills.

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
  - I used bootstrap to add some features to my website and to make it responsive. I later styled any bootstap I used to make it personalised for my site.
   


## Testing

When testing my website I went through each section and ensured that they all worked as intended and were responsive.

- I tested my form and made it as functional as I could with my current skills.
- I went through my user story of a potential employer and everything went smoothly except for my contact form. This form isn't functional as I haven't learned any JavaScript yet, I plan on fixing this issue in the future once I have the skills to do so.

I tested my website on all screen sizes and found it to be fully responsive
## Deployment
